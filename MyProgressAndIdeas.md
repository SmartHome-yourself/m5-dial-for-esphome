# Journaling my goals and archievements

## first steps

* âœ… compile original example
  * took a while to download a lot of stuff
  * `packages:  m5_tough_package:` not work - copies content in own `yaml`
* ðŸš§ create working `.yaml` for some of my home assistant lights
  * can compile and upload my `M5DialFirst.yaml` but it shows **DISCONNECTED** after **Offline**- no wifi, bit display is working
  * wifi credentials in clear not via secrets!
  * example scans wifi sucessfully!
* Try another `yaml` with only access to wifi and display?
* Change paths to my fork

## first goals

* add temperature control for lights
* dive deeper into custom code components
