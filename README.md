Additionally, the configuration must be expanded to include the external_component section, where ref must also be set as dev.  
This would look like this, for example:  
```
packages:
  m5_tough_package:
    url: https://github.com/SmartHome-yourself/m5-dial-for-esphome
    ref: dev
    file: shys-m5-dial.yaml

```
shys_m5_dial:
  ...
  devices:
    lock:
      - entity: lock.my_lock1
        name: Lock 1
```
  
**entity**  
Specifies the lock entity ID from Home Assistant to be controlled.  
  
**name**  
The name of the lock displayed on the screen.  
  
## modes (optional)
#### lock_mode
With the lock mode, the state of the lock entity can be controlled.  
The lock can be unlocked, locked, and opened using the rotary encoder.
A press on the button usually unlocks or locks the lock depending on the current state.
However, if *open_on_button* is set to *true*, pressing the button will open the lock directly instead of just unlocking it.  
  
**Code:**
```
shys_m5_dial:
  ...
  devices:
    lock:
      - entity: lock.my_lock1
        name: Lock 1
        modes:
          lock_mode:
            open_on_button: true
            rotary_step_width: 10
```
  
**open_on_button (optional)**  *(Default: false)*  
Setting to true will directly open the lock when pressing the button instead of just unlocking it.  
If the parameter is set to false (or not specified), the lock will only be unlocked but not fully opened.
*Valid values: true / false*  
  
**rotary_step_width (optional)**  *(Default: 1)*  
Specifies the general step width by which the value changes when using the rotary encoder per step.  
For lock mode of lock, 1 is the default value, regardless of what is set as the general standard in the component.  
If a step width of 2 is specified here, turning the encoder will not only unlock the lock but also automatically fully open it.  
*Valid values: 1 - 2*

## **Number / Input_Number**
Under "devices - number," all Number and Input-Number entities are listed.  
  
**Code:**
```
shys_m5_dial:
  ...
  devices:
    number:
      - entity: number.my_number
        name: Number 1
        modes:
          lock_mode:
            unit: mm
            rotary_step_width: 10
            
      - entity: input_number.my_input_number
        name: Input Number 1
```
  
**entity**  
Specifies the entity ID of the number from Home Assistant to be controlled.  
Both entities from the Number and Input-Number domains are supported here.
  
**name**  
The name of the entity displayed on the display.  
  
## modes (optional)
#### value_mode
The Value Mode allows controlling the value of the Number entity.  
The value can be set both using the rotary encoder and via touch.  

**Code:**
```
shys_m5_dial:
  ...
  devices:
    number:
      - entity: number.my_number
        name: Number 1
        modes:
          lock_mode:
            unit: mm
            rotary_step_width: 10
```
  
**unit (optional)** *(Default: '')*  
Specifies the unit to be displayed after the value of the number.  
  
**rotary_step_width (optional)**  
Specifies the general step width by which the value changes per step when using the rotary encoder.  
The value set here overrides the globally set value and only applies to the Value Mode of this Number entity.  
*Valid values 1 - 500*  
  
&nbsp;

## **Timer**
Under "devices - timer," all timer entities to be controlled via the Dial are listed.  
  
**Code:**
```
shys_m5_dial:
  ...
  devices:
    timer:
      - entity: timer.test_timer
        name: Test timer
        modes:
          timer_mode:
            rotary_step_width: 10        
```
  
**entity**  
Specifies the entity ID of the timer from Home Assistant to be controlled.  

**name**  
The name of the entity displayed on the display.  
  
## modes (optional)
#### timer_mode
The Timer Mode allows controlling the position of the timer entity.  
The position can be controlled both using the rotary encoder and via touch.  

**Code:**
```
shys_m5_dial:
  ...
  devices:
    timer:
      - entity: timer.my_timer
        name: Timer 1
        modes:
          timer_mode:
            rotary_step_width: 10
```
  
**rotary_step_width (optional)**  
Specifies the general step width by which the value changes per step when using the rotary encoder.  
The value set here overrides the globally set value and only applies to the Timer Mode of this Timer entity.  
*Valid values 1 - 500*

## Advanced
The following attributes are present, but generally should not need to be changed.  
  
**send_value_delay**  
Specifies the delay in milliseconds to wait after a value change before transmitting the change to Home Assistant.  
This is especially important when using the rotary encoder to avoid generating unnecessary API calls. *(Default: 1200)*
  
**send_value_lock**  
Specifies how long to wait after an API call before the next API call can be made. *(Default: 3000)*
